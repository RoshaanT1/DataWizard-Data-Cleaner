# 📊 AI-Powered Data Exploration Platform

Welcome to our submission for the **University Hackathon** hosted by the **Data Insights Club**! This platform empowers **non-technical users** to derive deep, actionable insights from real-world datasets — without writing a single line of code.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build an intuitive, AI-driven data exploration tool that:
- Uploads and processes messy CSV/Excel data
- Cleans and profiles the dataset using AI
- Generates smart visualizations and natural language summaries
- Allows users to query data in plain English
- Offers autonomous insights via an AI "Insight Agent"
- Exports polished, shareable reports

---

## 🧠 Core Features

### 📂 Upload Datasets
- Supports CSV and Excel formats
- Drag-and-drop interface or file picker

### 🧼 Auto Data Cleaning & Profiling
- AI detects column types, missing values, and outliers
- Automatically applies fixes (e.g., missing value imputation)
- Provides a profile summary with distributions and basic stats

### 📊 Smart Visualizations & Narrative Summaries
- Auto-generated charts (bar, line, pie, etc.)
- Descriptive narratives for each visualization
- Dynamic chart selection based on data type

### 💬 Natural Language Querying
- Users ask questions like:  
  “What are the top complaints by year?”  
  “Show average satisfaction by age group.”
- AI generates a visual + text-based response

### 🧠 Insight Agent (Agentic AI Mode)
- One-click autonomous analysis
- Profiles the dataset
- Detects hidden trends, anomalies, and clusters
- Suggests visualizations, filters, and next questions
- Responds interactively:  
  _“Would you like to compare by location or product category?”_
- Outputs an actionable visual + narrative summary

### 📤 Exportable Reports
- Create PDF or HTML reports with:
  - Key stats
  - Charts
  - AI-generated narratives
- Perfect for sharing or presentations

---

## 🧪 Sample Use Cases

- **Public Opinion Data**: Analyze satisfaction, trust, and media perception
- **Hotel Reviews**: Uncover service weak points and customer sentiment
- **E-Commerce Complaints**: Detect product/delivery issues
- **Education Feedback**: Visualize trends and predict dropouts
